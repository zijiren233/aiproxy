# Academic Paper Search MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) server that enables searching and retrieving academic paper information from multiple sources.

The server provides LLMs with:

- Real-time academic paper search functionality  
- Access to paper metadata and abstracts
- Ability to retrieve full-text content when available
- Structured data responses following the MCP specification

While primarily designed for integration with Anthropic's Claude Desktop client, the MCP specification allows for potential compatibility with other AI models and clients that support tool/function calling capabilities (e.g. OpenAI's API).

**Note**: This software is under active development. Features and functionality are subject to change.

## Setup

### Installing via Smithery

To install Academic Paper Search Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@afrise/academic-search-mcp-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @afrise/academic-search-mcp-server --client claude
```

***note*** this method is largely untested, as their server seems to be having trouble. you can follow the standalone instructions until smithery gets fixed.

### Installing via uv (manual install)

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
uv add "mcp[cli]" httpx
```

2. Set up required API keys in your environment or `.env` file:

```sh
#  These are not actually implemented
SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY=your_key_here 
CROSSREF_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Optional but recommended
```

3. Run the server:

```sh
uv run server.py
```

## Usage with Claude Desktop

1. Add the server to your Claude Desktop configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "academic-search": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run ", "/path/to/server/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY": "your_key_here",
        "CROSSREF_API_KEY": "your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Restart Claude Desktop
