## 🎯 Overview

### ✨ What is the Microsoft Learn Docs MCP Server?

The Microsoft Docs MCP Server is a cloud-hosted service that enables MCP hosts like GitHub Copilot and Cursor to search and retrieve accurate information directly from Microsoft's official documentation. By implementing the standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP), this service allows any compatible AI system to ground its responses in authoritative Microsoft content.

### 📊 Key Capabilities

- **High-Quality Content Retrieval**: Search and retrieve relevant content from Microsoft Learn, Azure documentation, Microsoft 365 documentation, and other official Microsoft sources.
- **Semantic Understanding**: Uses advanced vector search to find the most contextually relevant documentation for any query.
- **Optimized Chunking**: Returns up to 10 high-quality content chunks (each max 500 tokens), with article titles, URLs, and self-contained content excerpts.
- **Real-time Updates**: Access the latest Microsoft documentation as it's published.

## 🌐 The Microsoft Learn Docs MCP Server Endpoint

The Microsoft Learn Docs MCP Server is accessible to any IDE, agent, or tool that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Any compatible client can connect to the following **remote MCP endpoint**:

```
https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp
```

> **Note:** This endpoint is designed for programmatic access by MCP clients via Streamable HTTP. It does not support direct access from a web browser and may return a `405 Method Not Allowed` error if accessed manually.

**Example JSON configuration:**

```json
{
  "microsoft.docs.mcp": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp"
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Currently Supported Tools

| Tool Name | Description | Input Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| `microsoft_docs_search` | Performs semantic search against Microsoft official technical documentation | `query` (string): The search query for retrieval |

### Alternative Installation (for legacy clients or local configuration)

For clients that don't support native remote MCP servers or if you prefer local configuration, you can use `mcp-remote` as a proxy:

### ▶️ Getting Started

1. **For VS Code**: Open GitHub Copilot in VS Code and [switch to Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode)
2. **For Claude Desktop**: After adding the integration, you'll see the MCP tools icon in the chat interface
3. You should see the Learn Docs MCP Server in the list of available tools
4. Try a prompt that tells the agent to use the Docs MCP Server, such as "what are the az cli commands to create an Azure container app according to official Microsoft Learn documentation?"
5. The agent should be able to use the Docs MCP Server tools to complete your query

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### 💻 System Prompt

Even tool-friendly models like Claude Sonnet 4.0 will not default to calling MCP tools typically - they need to be given some encouragement in the form of "system prompts."

Here's an example of a Cursor rule (a system prompt) that will cause the LLM to utilize `microsoft.docs.mcp` more frequently:

## Querying Microsoft Documentation

You have access to an MCP server called `microsoft.docs.mcp` - this tool allows you to search through Microsoft's latest official documentation, and that information might be more detailed or newer than what's in your training data set.

When handling questions around how to work with native Microsoft technologies, such as C#, F#, ASP.NET Core, Microsoft.Extensions, NuGet, Entity Framework, the `dotnet` runtime - please use this tool for research purposes when dealing with specific / narrowly defined questions that may occur.

### ⚠️ Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Connection errors | Verify your network connection and that the server URL is correctly entered |
| No results returned | Try rephrasing your query with more specific technical terms |
| Tool not appearing in VS Code | Restart VS Code or check that the MCP extension is properly installed |
| HTTP status 405  | Method not allowed happens when a browser tries to connect to the endpoint. Try using the Docs MCP Server through VS Code GitHub Copilot or [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) instead. |
