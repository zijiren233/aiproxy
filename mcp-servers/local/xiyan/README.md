### Evaluation on MCPBench

The following figure illustrates the performance of the XiYan MCP server as measured by the MCPBench benchmark. The XiYan MCP server demonstrates superior performance compared to both the MySQL MCP server and the PostgreSQL MCP server, achieving a lead of 2-22 percentage points. The detailed experiment results can be found at [MCPBench](https://github.com/modelscope/MCPBench) and the report ["Evaluation Report on MCP Servers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11094).

### Tools Preview

- The tool ``get_data`` provides a natural language interface for retrieving data from a database. This server will convert the input natural language into SQL using a built-in model and call the database to return the query results.

- The ``{dialect}://{table_name}`` resource allows obtaining a portion of sample data from the database for model reference when a specific table_name is specified.
- The ``{dialect}://`` resource will list the names of the current databases

## Installation

### Installing from pip

Python 3.11+ is required.
You can install the server through pip, and it will install the latest version:

```shell
pip install xiyan-mcp-server
```

If you want to install the development version from source, you can install from source code on github:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/XGenerationLab/xiyan_mcp_server.git
```

### Installing from Smithery.ai

See [@XGenerationLab/xiyan_mcp_server](https://smithery.ai/server/@XGenerationLab/xiyan_mcp_server)

Not fully tested.

## Configuration

You need a YAML config file to configure the server.
A default config file is provided in config_demo.yml which looks like this:

```yaml
mcp:
  transport: "stdio"
model:
  name: "XGenerationLab/XiYanSQL-QwenCoder-32B-2412"
  key: ""
  url: "https://api-inference.modelscope.cn/v1/"
database:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  user: "root"
  password: ""
  database: ""
```

### MCP Configuration

You can set the transport protocol to ``stdio`` or ``sse``.

#### STDIO

For stdio protocol, you can set just like this:

```yaml
mcp:
  transport: "stdio"
```

#### SSE

For sse protocol, you can set mcp config as below:

```yaml
mcp:
  transport: "sse"
  port: 8000
  log_level: "INFO"
```

The default port is `8000`. You can change the port if needed.
The default log level is `ERROR`. We recommend to set log level to `INFO` for more detailed information.

Other configurations like `debug`, `host`, `sse_path`, `message_path` can be customized as well, but normally you don't need to modify them.

### LLM Configuration

``Name`` is the name of the model to use, ``key`` is the API key of the model, ``url`` is the API url of the model. We support following models.

| versions | general LLMs(GPT,qwenmax)                                             | SOTA model by Modelscope                   | SOTA model by Dashscope                                   | Local LLMs            |
|----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| description| basic, easy to use | best performance, stable, recommand        | best performance, for trial                               | slow, high-security   |
| name     | the official model name (e.g. gpt-3.5-turbo,qwen-max)                 | XGenerationLab/XiYanSQL-QwenCoder-32B-2412 | xiyansql-qwencoder-32b                                    | xiyansql-qwencoder-3b |
| key      | the API key of the service provider (e.g. OpenAI, Alibaba Cloud)      | the API key of modelscope                  | the API key via email                                     | ""                    |
| url      | the endpoint of the service provider (e.g."<https://api.openai.com/v1>") | <https://api-inference.modelscope.cn/v1/>    | <https://xiyan-stream.biz.aliyun.com/service/api/xiyan-sql> | <http://localhost:5090> |

#### General LLMs

If you want to use the general LLMs, e.g. gpt3.5, you can directly config like this:

```yaml
model:
  name: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  key: "YOUR KEY "
  url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
database:
```

If you want to use Qwen from Alibaba, e.g. Qwen-max, you can use following config:

```yaml
model:
  name: "qwen-max"
  key: "YOUR KEY "
  url: "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
database:
```

#### Text-to-SQL SOTA model

We recommend the XiYanSQL-qwencoder-32B (<https://github.com/XGenerationLab/XiYanSQL-QwenCoder>), which is the SOTA model in text-to-sql, see [Bird benchmark](https://bird-bench.github.io/).
There are two ways to use the model. You can use either of them.
(1) [Modelscope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/XGenerationLab/XiYanSQL-QwenCoder-32B-2412),  (2) Alibaba Cloud DashScope.

##### (1) Modelscope version

You need to apply a ``key`` of API-inference from Modelscope, <https://www.modelscope.cn/docs/model-service/API-Inference/intro>
Then you can use the following config:

```yaml
model:
  name: "XGenerationLab/XiYanSQL-QwenCoder-32B-2412"
  key: ""
  url: "https://api-inference.modelscope.cn/v1/"
```

Read our [model description](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/XGenerationLab/XiYanSQL-QwenCoder-32B-2412) for more details.

##### (2) Dashscope version

We deployed the model on Alibaba Cloud DashScope, so you need to set the following environment variables:
Send me your email to get the ``key``. ( <godot.lzl@alibaba-inc.com> )
In the email, please attach the following information:

```yaml
name: "YOUR NAME",
email: "YOUR EMAIL",
organization: "your college or Company or Organization"
```

We will send you a ``key`` according to your email. And you can fill the ``key`` in the yml file.
The ``key`` will be expired by  1 month or 200 queries or other legal restrictions.

```yaml
model:
  name: "xiyansql-qwencoder-32b"
  key: "KEY"
  url: "https://xiyan-stream.biz.aliyun.com/service/api/xiyan-sql"
```

Note: this model service is just for trial, if you need to use it in production, please contact us.

##### (3) Local version

Alternatively, you can also deploy the model [XiYanSQL-qwencoder-32B](https://github.com/XGenerationLab/XiYanSQL-QwenCoder) on your own server.
See [Local Model](src/xiyan_mcp_server/local_model/README.md) for more details.

### Database Configuration

``host``, ``port``, ``user``, ``password``, ``database`` are the connection information of the database.

You can use local or any remote databases. Now we support MySQL and PostgreSQL(more dialects soon).

#### MySQL

```yaml
database:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  user: "root"
  password: ""
  database: ""
```

#### PostgreSQL

Step 1: Install Python packages

```bash
pip install psycopg2
```

Step 2: prepare the config.yml like this:

```yaml
database:
  dialect: "postgresql"
  host: "localhost"
  port: 5432
  user: ""
  password: ""
  database: ""
```

Note that ``dialect`` should be ``postgresql`` for postgresql.

## Launch

### Server Launch

If you want to launch server with `sse`, you have to run the following command in a terminal:

```shell
YML=path/to/yml python -m xiyan_mcp_server
```

Then you should see the information on <http://localhost:8000/sse> in your browser. (Defaultly, change if your mcp server runs on other host/port)

Otherwise, if you use `stdio` transport protocol, you usually declare the mcp server command in specific mcp application instead of launching it in a terminal.
However, you can still debug with this command if needed.

### Client Setting

#### Claude Desktop

Add this in your Claude Desktop config file, ref <a href="https://github.com/XGenerationLab/xiyan_mcp_server/blob/main/imgs/claude_desktop.jpg">Claude Desktop config example</a>

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "xiyan-mcp-server": {
            "command": "/xxx/python",
            "args": [
                "-m",
                "xiyan_mcp_server"
            ],
            "env": {
                "YML": "PATH/TO/YML"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Please note that the Python command here requires the complete path to the Python executable (`/xxx/python`); otherwise, the Python interpreter cannot be found. You can determine this path by using the command `which python`. The same applies to other applications as well.**

Claude Desktop currently does not support the SSE transport protocol.

#### Cline

Prepare the config like [Claude Desktop](#claude-desktop)

#### Goose

If you use `stdio`, add following command in the config, ref <a href="https://github.com/XGenerationLab/xiyan_mcp_server/blob/main/imgs/goose.jpg">Goose config example</a>

```shell
env YML=path/to/yml /xxx/python -m xiyan_mcp_server
```

Otherwise, if you use `sse`, change Type to `SSE` and set the endpoint to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse`

#### Cursor

Use the similar command as follows.

For `stdio`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xiyan-mcp-server": {
      "command": "/xxx/python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "xiyan_mcp_server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "YML": "path/to/yml"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For `sse`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xiyan_mcp_server_1": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Witsy

Add following in command:

```shell
/xxx/python -m xiyan_mcp_server
```

Add an env: key is YML and value is the path to your yml file.
