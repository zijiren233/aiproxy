## 🌟 Overview

Transform how you interact with your macOS calendar using natural language! The mcp-ical server leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to turn your calendar management into a conversational experience.

```bash
You: "What's my schedule for next week?"
Claude: "Let me check that for you..."
[Displays a clean overview of your upcoming week]

You: "Add a lunch meeting with Sarah tomorrow at noon"
Claude: "✨ 📅 Created: Lunch with Sarah Tomorrow, 12:00 PM"
```

### 📊 Calendar Management

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Since you can create events in custom calendars, if you have your Google Calendar synced with your iCloud Calendar, you can use this MCP server to create events in your Google Calendar too! Just specify the Google calendar when creating/updating events.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> 💡 **Note**: While these instructions focus on setting up the MCP server with Claude for Desktop, this server can be used with any MCP-compatible client. For more details on using different clients, see [the MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client).

### Prerequisites

- [uv package manager](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- macOS with Calendar app configured
- An MCP client - [Claude for desktop](https://claude.ai/download) is recommended

### Installation

Whilst this MCP server can be used with any MCP compatible client, the instructions below are for use with Claude for desktop.

1. **Clone and Setup**

    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/Omar-V2/mcp-ical.git
    cd mcp-ical

    # Install dependencies
    uv sync
    ```

2. **Configure Claude for Desktop**

    Create or edit `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "mcp-ical": {
                "command": "uv",
                "args": [
                    "--directory",
                    "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/mcp-ical",
                    "run",
                    "mcp-ical"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Launch Claude for Calendar Access**

    > ⚠️ **Critical**: Claude must be launched from the terminal to properly request calendar permissions. Launching directly from Finder will not trigger the permissions prompt.

    Run the following command in your terminal.

    ```bash
    /Applications/Claude.app/Contents/MacOS/Claude
    ```

    > ⚠️ **Warning**: Alternatively, you can [manually grant calendar access](docs/install.md#method-2-manually-grant-calendar-access), but this involves modifying system files and should only be done if you understand the risks involved.

4. **Start Using!**

    ```text
    Try: "What's my schedule looking like for next week?"
    ```

> 🔑 **Note**: When you first use a calendar-related command, macOS will prompt for calendar access. This prompt will only appear if you launched Claude from the terminal as specified above.

## 🧪 Testing

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Tests will create temporary calendars and events. While cleanup is automatic, only run tests in development environments.

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run test suite
uv run pytest tests
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Recurring Events
