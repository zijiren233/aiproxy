## III. MCP Server Configuration

Add the following content to the MCP Client (such as Claude for Desktop) configuration file to configure this tool as an MCP Server:

### Mac Configuration Example

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "xiaohongshu MCP": {
            "command": "/absolute/path/to/venv/bin/python3",
            "args": [
                "/absolute/path/to/xiaohongshu_mcp.py",
                "--stdio"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Windows Configuration Example

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "xiaohongshu MCP": {
            "command": "C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\MCP\\Redbook-Search-Comment-MCP2.0\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
            "args": [
                "C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\MCP\\Redbook-Search-Comment-MCP2.0\\xiaohongshu_mcp.py",
                "--stdio"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

> **Important Notes**:
>
> - Please use the **complete absolute path** of the Python interpreter in your virtual environment
> - Mac example: `/Users/username/Desktop/RedBook-Search-Comment-MCP/venv/bin/python3`
> - Windows example: `C:\Users\username\Desktop\MCP\Redbook-Search-Comment-MCP2.0\venv\Scripts\python.exe`
> - Similarly, xiaohongshu_mcp.py also needs to use a **complete absolute path**
> - Backslashes in Windows paths need to be double-escaped in JSON (using `\\`)

### Python Command Differences (python vs python3)

In different system environments, Python commands may vary depending on your system configuration. Here's how to determine which command you should use:

1. **Determine Your Python Command**:
   - Run in terminal: `python --version` and `python3 --version`
   - Check which command returns a Python 3.x version (this project requires Python 3.8+)

2. **Confirm in Virtual Environment**:
   - After activating the virtual environment, run `which python` or `where python` (Windows)
   - This will display the complete path of the Python interpreter

3. **Use the Correct Command in Configuration**:
   - Mac: Usually `python3` or `python` in the virtual environment
   - Windows: Usually `python` or `python.exe`

In the configuration file, always use the **complete absolute path** of the Python interpreter in your virtual environment, not the command name.

## V. User Guide

### 0. Working Principle

This tool uses a two-step process to implement smart commenting:

1. **Note Analysis**: Calls the `post_smart_comment` tool to get note information (title, author, content, etc.)

2. **Comment Generation and Publishing**:
   - The MCP client (such as Claude) generates comments based on note analysis results
   - Calls the `post_comment` tool to publish the comment

This design fully utilizes the AI capabilities of the MCP client to generate more natural and relevant comments.

### 1. Usage in MCP Client

#### Basic Operations

| Function | Example Command |
|---------|----------|
| **Search Notes** | `Help me search for Xiaohongshu notes about [keyword]` |
| **Get Note Content** | `Help me view the content of this Xiaohongshu note: https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/xxxx` |
| **Analyze Note** | `Help me analyze this Xiaohongshu note: https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/xxxx` |
| **Get Comments** | `Help me view the comments on this note: https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/xxxx` |
| **Generate Comment** | `Help me write a [type] comment for this Xiaohongshu note: https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/xxxx` |

#### Comment Type Options

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Traffic-driving** | Guide users to follow or private message | Increase followers or private message interactions |
| **Like-oriented** | Simple interactions to gain goodwill | Increase exposure and interaction rate |
| **Inquiry-based** | Increase interaction in the form of questions | Trigger blogger replies, increase interaction depth |
| **Professional** | Display professional knowledge to establish authority | Build professional image, enhance credibility |

### 2. Actual Workflow Example

```
User: Help me write a professional type comment for this Xiaohongshu note: https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/xxxx

Claude: I'll help you write a professional type comment. Let me get the note content and generate a comment.
[Calls post_smart_comment tool]

# Tool returns note analysis results, including title, author, content, domain, and keywords

Claude: I've obtained the note information, this is a note about [topic]. Based on the content, I generated and posted the following professional comment:

"[Generated professional comment content]"

[Calls post_comment tool]

Claude: Comment successfully posted!
```

**Note**: In the above process, the `post_smart_comment` tool is only responsible for retrieving note analysis results and returning them to the MCP client. The actual comment generation is done by the MCP client (such as Claude) itself.

### 3. Working Principle

The new version of the Xiaohongshu MCP tool adopts a modular design, divided into three core modules:

1. **Note Analysis Module** (analyze_note)
   - Retrieves the title, author, publication time, and content of the note
   - Analyzes the domain and keywords of the note
   - Returns structured note information

2. **Comment Generation Module** (implemented by the MCP client)
   - Receives note analysis results
   - Generates natural, relevant comments based on note content and comment type
   - Allows users to preview and modify comments before publishing

3. **Comment Publishing Module** (post_comment)
   - Receives generated comment content
   - Locates and operates the comment input box
   - Publishes the comment and returns results

## VI. Code Structure

- **xiaohongshu_mcp.py**: The core file implementing the main functions, including login, search, content and comment retrieval, comment publishing, and other code logic.
- **requirements.txt**: Records the dependencies required by the project.

## VII. Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Connection Failure**:
   - Ensure you're using the **complete absolute path** of the Python interpreter in your virtual environment
   - Ensure the MCP server is running
   - Try restarting the MCP server and client

2. **Browser Session Issues**:
   If you encounter a `Page.goto: Target page, context or browser has been closed` error:
   - Restart the MCP server
   - Reconnect and log in again

3. **Dependency Installation Issues**:
   If you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError` error:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed in the virtual environment
   - Check if the fastmcp package is installed

## VIII. Notes and Troubleshooting

### 1. Usage Notes

- **Browser Mode**: The tool runs in Playwright's non-headless mode, opening a real browser window during execution
- **Login Method**: First-time login requires manual QR code scanning; subsequent uses don't require rescanning if the login state is valid
- **Platform Rules**: Please strictly follow Xiaohongshu platform regulations during use, avoid excessive operations to prevent account banning risks
- **Comment Frequency**: It's recommended to control comment posting frequency, avoid posting a large number of comments in a short time, and limit the number of comments posted per day to no more than 30

### 2. Common Issues and Solutions

#### Browser Instance Issues

If you encounter errors like "Page.goto: Target page, context or browser has been closed", it may be due to browser instances not closing correctly or data directory lock file issues. Try:

```bash
# Delete browser lock files
rm -f /project_path/browser_data/SingletonLock /project_path/browser_data/SingletonCookie

# If the problem persists, backup and rebuild the browser data directory
mkdir -p /project_path/backup_browser_data
mv /project_path/browser_data/* /project_path/backup_browser_data/
mkdir -p /project_path/browser_data
```

#### Content Retrieval Issues

If you cannot retrieve note content or the content is incomplete, try:

1. **Increase Wait Time**: Xiaohongshu note pages may need longer loading times, especially for notes with many images or videos
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes browser cache can affect content retrieval
3. **Try Different Retrieval Methods**: The tool integrates multiple retrieval methods; if one method fails, try others

#### Platform Changes Adaptation

The Xiaohongshu platform may update page structure and DOM elements, causing the tool to malfunction. If you encounter such issues:

1. **Check Project Updates**: Pay attention to the latest version of the project and update in a timely manner
2. **Adjust Selectors**: If you're familiar with the code, try adjusting CSS selectors or XPath expressions
3. **Submit Issue Feedback**: Submit issues to the project maintainer, describing the specific problems and page changes encountered

## IX. Disclaimer

This tool is for learning and research purposes only. Users should strictly comply with relevant laws, regulations, and Xiaohongshu platform rules. The project developers are not responsible for any issues caused by improper use.
