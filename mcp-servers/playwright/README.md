## Playwright MCP

> <https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp>

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.

### Key Features

- **Fast and lightweight**. Uses Playwright's accessibility tree, not pixel-based input.
- **LLM-friendly**. No vision models needed, operates purely on structured data.
- **Deterministic tool application**. Avoids ambiguity common with screenshot-based approaches.

### Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop or any other MCP client

### Getting started

First, install the Playwright MCP server with your client. A typical configuration looks like this:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### User profile

You can run Playwright MCP with persistent profile like a regular browser (default), or in the isolated contexts for the testing sessions.

**Persistent profile**

All the logged in information will be stored in the persistent profile, you can delete it between sessions if you'd like to clear the offline state.
Persistent profile is located at the following locations and you can override it with the `--user-data-dir` argument.

```bash
# Windows
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\mcp-{channel}-profile

# macOS
- ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-{channel}-profile

# Linux
- ~/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-{channel}-profile
```

**Isolated**

In the isolated mode, each session is started in the isolated profile. Every time you ask MCP to close the browser,
the session is closed and all the storage state for this session is lost. You can provide initial storage state
to the browser via the config's `contextOptions` or via the `--storage-state` argument. Learn more about the storage
state [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth).

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--isolated",
        "--storage-state={path/to/storage.json}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration file

The Playwright MCP server can be configured using a JSON configuration file. You can specify the configuration file
using the `--config` command line option:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --config path/to/config.json
```

<details>
<summary>Configuration file schema</summary>

    browserName?: 'chromium' | 'firefox' | 'webkit';

    isolated?: boolean;

### Standalone MCP server

When running headed browser on system w/o display or from worker processes of the IDEs,
run the MCP server from environment with the DISPLAY and pass the `--port` flag to enable SSE transport.

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931
```

And then in MCP client config, set the `url` to the SSE endpoint:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8931/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary><b>Docker</b></summary>

**NOTE:** The Docker implementation only supports headless chromium at the moment.

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "--init", "--pull=always", "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can build the Docker image yourself.

```
docker build -t mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp .
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Programmatic usage</b></summary>

```js
import http from 'http';

import { createConnection } from '@playwright/mcp';
import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js';

http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  // ...

  // Creates a headless Playwright MCP server with SSE transport
  const connection = await createConnection({ browser: { launchOptions: { headless: true } } });
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/messages', res);
  await connection.sever.connect(transport);

  // ...
});
```

</details>

### Tools

The tools are available in two modes:

1. **Snapshot Mode** (default): Uses accessibility snapshots for better performance and reliability
2. **Vision Mode**: Uses screenshots for visual-based interactions

To use Vision Mode, add the `--vision` flag when starting the server:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--vision"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Vision Mode works best with the computer use models that are able to interact with elements using
X Y coordinate space, based on the provided screenshot.
